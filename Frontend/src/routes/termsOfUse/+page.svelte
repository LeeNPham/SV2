		If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute
		(except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by
		binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE
		IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the
		Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where
		appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer
		Rules"), both of which are available at the
		<a href="https://www.adr.org/" class="mb-4 font-md text-SV2-hyperlink underline"
			>American Arbitration Association (AAA) website</a
		>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA
		Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be
		conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator
		will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by
		either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the
		arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or
		applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Salt Lake, Utah. Except as otherwise provided
		herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending
		arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
		arbitrator. If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute
		shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Multnomah, Oregon,
		and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and
		forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.
		Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
		and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal
		Terms. In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services
		be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found
		to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling
		within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute
		shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
		above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

	<p class="font-lg font-bold mb-4">Restrictions</p>
	<p class="mb-4 font-md">
		The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
		individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any
		other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
		class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority
		for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general
		public or any other persons.

		of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising
		from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim
		for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither
		Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to
		be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
